    "You are planning to buy an apartment. The desired property currently costs PLN 120,000, but you predict that apartment prices will grow at a rate of 5% per year for the next 5 years. At the moment, you do not have sufficient funds, so you find an offer from a bank that proposes a deposit to which you add a certain fixed amount at the end of each month. The bank offers a nominal annual interest rate of 12%, with monthly compounding.\n",
